# Project Work Breakdown Structure for RadioX Free Edition

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) provides a detailed and comprehensive breakdown of all tasks required to develop RadioX Free Edition, a web application that converts X posts into audio clips for podcast distribution. The WBS organizes the project into hierarchical phases and tasks, ensuring all deliverables are clearly defined and aligned with the requirements outlined in the RadioX Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD), Product Description, and Target Audience Analysis. It serves as a roadmap for the project team to execute the development process efficiently, meeting the needs of content creators, accessibility advocates, small businesses, and niche content communities while adhering to X API Free Tier constraints (500 posts/month, 100 read requests/month).

### 1.2 Scope
The WBS covers the entire project lifecycle, from initiation to closure, with a focus on the development of RadioX Free Edition. It includes tasks for project planning, frontend and backend development, API integration, testing, deployment, and ongoing monitoring. The structure ensures the application is user-friendly, WCAG-compliant, secure, and scalable, addressing both functional requirements (e.g., hashtag search, audio conversion) and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security).

### 1.3 Context
RadioX Free Edition enables users to search X posts by hashtags, convert them into audio clips using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS), manage audio libraries, generate podcast RSS feeds, and monitor API usage. Built with a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, Redis for caching, and AWS S3 for storage, the application targets tech-savvy but non-technical users aged 25-45. The WBS is designed to deliver a robust solution that maximizes the value of social media content within API limits.

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure

The WBS is organized into five main phases: Project Initiation, Project Planning, Project Execution, Project Monitoring and Controlling, and Project Closure. Each phase is decomposed into tasks and subtasks, ensuring all aspects of the project are covered.

### 2.1 Project Initiation
This phase establishes the projectâ€™s foundation by defining objectives, scope, and stakeholders.

| WBS ID | Task | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 1.1 | Develop Project Charter | Define objectives, identify stakeholders, outline high-level requirements, and establish project authority. |
| 1.2 | Conduct Stakeholder Analysis | Identify stakeholders (e.g., developers, users), analyze needs, and develop engagement strategy. |
| 1.3 | Define Project Scope | Create scope statement, define deliverables (e.g., application, documentation), and identify exclusions (e.g., paid tier features). |
| 1.4 | Identify Project Risks | Conduct risk identification workshop and document initial risk register (e.g., API limit risks). |

### 2.2 Project Planning
This phase involves detailed planning to ensure efficient execution.

| WBS ID | Task | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 2.1 | Create Work Breakdown Structure | Decompose project scope into work packages and assign to team members. |
| 2.2 | Develop Project Schedule | Sequence activities, estimate durations, and develop schedule baseline. |
| 2.3 | Estimate Costs | Estimate resource costs (e.g., cloud services, tools) and develop cost baseline. |
| 2.4 | Define Quality Standards | Define quality metrics (e.g., WCAG compliance, performance) and develop quality management plan. |
| 2.5 | Plan Communications | Define communication requirements and develop communication plan (e.g., status updates). |
| 2.6 | Plan Risk Management | Develop risk management plan and update risk register with response plans. |
| 2.7 | Plan Procurement | Identify procurement needs (e.g., cloud services) and develop procurement plan, if applicable. |

### 2.3 Project Execution
This phase encompasses the development, testing, and deployment of RadioX, divided into frontend, backend, API integration, testing, and deployment
