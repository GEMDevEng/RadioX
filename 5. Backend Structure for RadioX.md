# Backend Structure for RadioX

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the backend structure for RadioX, a web application designed to convert X posts into audio clips for podcast distribution. The backend is responsible for handling user interactions, managing data, processing audio conversions, integrating with external services, and ensuring compliance with the X API Free Tier constraints (500 posts/month, 100 read requests/month). This document outlines the architecture, technologies, components, API design, security, performance, and deployment strategies to support the applicationâ€™s functionality.

### 1.2 Overview
RadioX Free Edition enables users to transform up to 500 X posts per month into professional audio clips using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS), with features like RSS feed generation for podcast distribution. The backend supports:
- User authentication and account management
- Hashtag-based post searches via the X API
- Audio conversion with voice and music customization
- Podcast creation and RSS feed generation
- API usage monitoring to stay within Free Tier limits

The target audience includes content creators, accessibility advocates, and small businesses, typically aged 25-45, who are tech-savvy but not developers. The backend is built to be scalable, secure, and optimized for performance to meet their needs.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The backend follows a client-server architecture, with the frontend (React and Tailwind CSS) communicating via RESTful API endpoints. The backend comprises three main components:
- **Application Server**: Handles HTTP requests, user sessions, and API endpoints.
- **Processing Service**: Manages asynchronous tasks like audio conversion and RSS feed generation.
- **Data Storage**: Includes MongoDB for structured data, AWS S3 or similar for audio files, and Redis for caching and session management.

### 2.2 Component Interactions
- The frontend sends requests to the Application Server for actions like login, search, or audio conversion.
- The Application Server processes requests, interacts with MongoDB, Redis, or external APIs (X API, Google Cloud TTS), and returns responses.
- For resource-intensive tasks (e.g., audio conversion), the Application Server enqueues jobs in the Processing Service using Redis-based job queues.
- The Processing Service executes jobs, stores results in object storage, and notifies the Application Server.
- The Application Server retrieves processed data (e.g., audio files) and delivers it to the frontend.

## 3. Backend Technologies

### 3.1 Programming Languages and Frameworks
- **Node.js (v16+)**: Runtime environment for the backend, chosen for its asynchronous capabilities ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org)).
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs, providing middleware for request handling ([Express.js](https://expressjs.com)).

### 3.2 Database
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, audio metadata, podcast feeds, and usage statistics.
  - Collections: Users, AudioClips, PodcastFeeds, UsageStats.
  - Indexed fields: User ID, Audio ID, Podcast ID for query performance ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)).

### 3.3 Caching
- **Redis**: Used for caching search results, user sessions, rate limiting counters, and job queues.
  - TTL settings: 1 hour for search results, 24 hours for user preferences ([Redis](https://redis.io)).

### 3.4 Object Storage
