# Project Rules for RadioX Free Edition

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the rules and guidelines for the development of RadioX Free Edition, a web application designed to convert X posts into high-quality audio clips for podcast distribution. These rules ensure the project is executed efficiently, meets all functional and non-functional requirements, and adheres to best practices in software development, accessibility, and security. The document addresses the unique constraints of the X API Free Tier (500 posts/month, 100 read requests/month) and the needs of the target audience, including content creators, accessibility advocates, small businesses, and niche content communities.

### 1.2 Scope
The project rules cover all aspects of the development process, including project governance, development methodology, communication protocols, quality management, risk management, change management, compliance, security, development standards, and deployment procedures. The application is built with a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, Redis for caching, and AWS S3 for audio storage, integrating with the X API and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS) API.

### 1.3 Project Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly, WCAG-compliant web application that enables users to convert X posts into audio clips and publish podcasts.
- Ensure the application operates within X API Free Tier limits while maintaining performance (e.g., API response time < 500ms).
- Meet the needs of diverse users by providing accessible, high-quality audio output and efficient content management.
- Deploy a secure, scalable application on a cloud platform with automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Comply with GDPR for data protection and WCAG 2.1 Level AA for accessibility.
