# Comprehensive Task List for Developing RadioX Free Edition

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed and comprehensive task list for the development of RadioX Free Edition, a web application that converts X posts into high-quality audio clips for podcast distribution. The task list is derived from the Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD) and other provided attachments, ensuring all functional and non-functional requirements are addressed. It serves as a guide for the development team to implement a user-friendly, accessible, and secure application while adhering to the X API Free Tier constraints (500 posts/month, 100 read requests/month).

### 1.2 Scope
The task list covers all development activities required to build RadioX Free Edition, including frontend and backend implementation, API integration, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Tasks are organized into categories corresponding to core features, secondary features, and non-functional requirements, ensuring a structured approach to delivering a scalable and compliant application for content creators, accessibility advocates, small businesses, and niche content communities.

### 1.3 Context
RadioX Free Edition enables users to search X posts by hashtags, convert them into audio clips using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS), manage audio libraries, generate podcast RSS feeds, and monitor API usage. Built with a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, Redis for caching, and AWS S3 for storage, the application targets tech-savvy but non-technical users aged 25-45. The task list ensures the application meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for accessibility, GDPR for data protection, and performance targets like API responses under 500ms.

## 3. Additional Considerations

### 3.1 Accessibility
All tasks related to UI development (e.g., T1.1, T2.1, T4.1) must incorporate semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation to ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. Accessibility testing (T15.6) will validate these requirements.

### 3.2 Compliance
Tasks involving user data (e.g., T7.1, T7.4, T14.5) must adhere to GDPR, ensuring data minimization, user rights, and secure storage. Regular audits will confirm compliance.

### 3.3 Risk Management
To mitigate risks such as exceeding X API limits, tasks like T1.4 and T1.6 focus on caching and optimization. Security risks are addressed through tasks like T14.1-T14.5, with regular testing (T15.5) to identify vulnerabilities.

## 4. Conclusion
This task list provides a comprehensive and actionable set of tasks for developing RadioX Free Edition, covering all core and secondary features, as well as non-functional requirements.
