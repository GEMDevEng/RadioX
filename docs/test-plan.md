## Test Environments
1. **Development**: For unit and integration tests
2. **Staging**: For end-to-end, performance, and security tests
3. **Production-like**: For final verification before deployment

## Test Schedule
1. **Week 1**: Complete all unit tests
2. **Week 2**: Complete all integration tests
3. **Week 3**: Complete all end-to-end tests
4. **Week 4**: Perform performance and security tests

## Responsibilities
- **Backend Developers**: Unit and integration tests for backend
- **Frontend Developers**: Unit and integration tests for frontend
- **QA Team**: End-to-end, performance, and security tests
- **DevOps**: Test environment setup and maintenance

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests must pass before production deployment
- No critical or high-severity security issues
- Performance meets or exceeds defined SLAs
- All test coverage goals met

## Reporting
- Daily test execution reports
- Weekly test coverage reports
- Immediate notification for critical failures
