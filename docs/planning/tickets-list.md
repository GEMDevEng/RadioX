# Comprehensive Tickets List for Developing RadioX Free Edition

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed and comprehensive tickets list for the development of RadioX Free Edition, a web application designed to convert X posts into high-quality audio clips for podcast distribution. The tickets ensure all functional and non-functional requirements are addressed, guiding the development team in building a user-friendly, accessible, and secure application while adhering to the X API Free Tier constraints (500 posts/month, 100 read requests/month).

### 1.2 Scope
The tickets list covers all development activities required to build RadioX Free Edition, including frontend and backend implementation, API integration, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Tickets are organized into categories corresponding to core features, secondary features, and non-functional requirements, ensuring a structured approach to delivering a scalable and compliant application for content creators, accessibility advocates, small businesses, and niche content communities.

### 1.3 Context
RadioX Free Edition enables users to search X posts by hashtags, convert them into audio clips using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS), manage audio libraries, generate podcast RSS feeds, and monitor API usage. Built with a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, Redis for caching, and AWS S3 for storage, the application targets tech-savvy but non-technical users aged 25-45. The tickets ensure the application meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for accessibility, GDPR for data protection, and performance targets like API responses under 500ms.

## 3. Additional Considerations

### 3.1 Accessibility
Tickets related to UI development (e.g., TK-1, TK-6, TK-13) must ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance through semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation. Accessibility testing (TK-54) will validate these requirements.

### 3.2 Compliance
Tickets involving user data (e.g., TK-22, TK-25, TK-48) must adhere to GDPR, ensuring data minimization, user rights, and secure storage. Regular audits will confirm compliance.

### 3.3 Risk Management
To mitigate risks like exceeding X API limits, tickets such as TK-3 and TK-5 focus on caching and optimization. Security risks are addressed through tickets like TK-44-TK-48, with testing (TK-53) to identify vulnerabilities.

## 4. Conclusion
This tickets list provides a comprehensive and actionable set of tasks for developing RadioX Free Edition, covering all core and secondary features, as well as non-functional requirements.
