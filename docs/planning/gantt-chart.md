## Critical Path

The critical path defines the sequence of tasks that determines the project’s minimum completion time. For RadioX Free Edition, it includes:

- **Initiation → Planning → Execution (Sprints 1-12) → Deployment → Closure**

Key dependencies along the critical path:
- UI/UX design must be completed before frontend implementation.
- API development must precede integration and testing.
- Testing cannot begin until all features are implemented.

Delays in these tasks will directly impact the project timeline.

## Resource Allocation

- **Project Manager**: Oversees Initiation, Planning, and Closure phases.
- **UI/UX Designer**: Designs interfaces for each sprint.
- **Frontend Developer**: Implements UI components across sprints.
- **Backend Developer**: Builds APIs and integrates external services.
- **QA Engineer**: Conducts testing during the final sprints.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages cloud infrastructure and deployment.
